## PDFMiner - how to extract text behind LTFigure

Problem: pdfminer seems unable to extract text that is "hidden" behind `LTFigure` object.

See `document.pdf` file and `index.ipynb` notebook for demonstration.

The content in the document that is not read is in two tables:

- one with 2014 and 2013 in the header in the upper half of the page
- second at the very bottom of the page
